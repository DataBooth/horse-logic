## Initial chat

### What is the problem you are trying to solve?

- Un-yet built device for capturing a specific horse behaviours
- Sensor data - measure latency between trials and other metrics
- Potentially use Raspberry Pi and/or PC/Matlab to interface with sensors
- Need to start data collection in August
- UK collaborators â€” understand hardware piece
- Might go with touch screen solution (probably not)
- IR sensors don't work well :(
- Remote control - button - signal (human in the loop) - not ideal
- Prefer fully automated data collection

### Where are you doing the experiments? 

- Wagga Wagga (onsite)
- Sensors and collection device with be co-located and mains power available
- Sensor on a fence and device directly connected

### Other

- Talked about potential of Python in Google Colab environment (freely available)
- Could also demo/show you remotely what this looks like

### Actions

- CH: Investigate Matlab license fees (is it available under University license or additional charge)
- CH: Send video to of manual experiment
- MB: Look at how sensor data <--> Raspberry Pi / Python typically work together

### Follow-up questions

1. How long will each experiment last (duration) e.g. minutes, hours, days?
2. Do you want to keep a record of each run (even if it "fails")? What about if power fails (e.g. have a partial record)?
3. How frequently (typically) will each observation occur? How many sensors / components to each observation (same timestamp?)
4. What are the details of the hardware interface (when available)?
5. How many data points per second (per sensor) do you expect to collect? i.e. estimate of data size per experiment
6. Where will the data be stored? (e.g. first local disk, then Cloud, etc.)
7. Will the Raspberry Pi be connected to the internet?
8. What storage will be available on the device? (e.g. SD card, SSD USB drive etc.)
9. How will the data be transferred from the device to the storage location? (e.g. USB, network, etc.)
10. Will WiFi be available at the site?
11. Do you have a GitHub account? (or similar)
12. Do you have a Google account? (for Google Colab and Drive)
13. What type of sensor(s) will be used? Do they produce a digital or analog signals?
14. What do you want to do with the data after it is collected? (e.g. analysis, visualisation, etc.)
15. Is any data processing required before storage? (e.g. filtering, etc.)
16. Any real-time processing required? (e.g. feedback to sensors, etc.)
17. How many horses are involved in the experiment? Is it a separate experiment for each horse?
