## Initial chat

### What is the problem you are trying to solve?

- Un-yet built device for horses 
- Sensor data - measure latency between trials
- Potentially use RasberryPI and/or PC/Matlab
- Need to start data collection in August
- UK collaborators â€” understand hardware piece
- Might go with touch screen solution (probably not)
- IR sensors don't work well :(
- Remote control - button - signal (human in the loop) - not ideal
- Prefer fully automated data collection

### Where are you doing the experiments? 

- Wagga Wagga (onsite)
- Sensors and collection device with be co-located and mains power available
- Sensor on a fence and device directly connected

### Other

- Talked about potential of Python in Google Colab environment (freely available)
- Could also demo/show you remotely what this looks like

### Actions

- CH: Investigate Matlab license fees (is it available under University license or additional charge)
- CH: Send video to of manual experiment
- MB: Look at how sensor data <--> RasberryPI / Python typically work together
