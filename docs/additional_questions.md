## Additional questions

1. Will the experiments also be recorded (video)?
2. Will the experiments be conducted in a controlled environment (e.g. indoors)?
3. Recording of prevailing (weather) conditions? e.g. Barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, etc.
4. Use of local devices (or BoM API)? e.g. https://github.com/tonyallan/weather-au
5. Wagga-Wagga weather: http://www.bom.gov.au/places/nsw/wagga-wagga/ (there are also historical records available)
