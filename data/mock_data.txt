Acquisition

Horse enters test chute - Q. How can you tell when the "horse is ready / settled"? (this seems to be a variable length process)

Start tone sounds (is this "zero" time at the start of the sound? Or is there recording that happens before this?) - 1 sec duration

Latency between start tone and first touch sensor activation

Horse touches panel with nose activating touch sensor

Only the first touch is registered, further touches not registered until next trial

Correct response tone sounds 0.5 sec duration (triggered by touch event?)

Wait period 2-3 sec (after end of sound?)

Servo motor engages, dispenses feed via chute to receptacle (Q. could the feed get stuck? If so?)

50gms feed dispensed

Horse consumes (will horse necessarily consume on demand? Does it matter if food is consumed?)

10-20 sec

Time out

Fixed duration based on average consumption time

Total length of trial

Next trial-repeat sequence x 10 trials per session?

Final trial-end tone

1 sec dur

Total length of session per horse

Session ends, horse removed from chute
